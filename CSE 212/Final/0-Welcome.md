# Python Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial. Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Conditionals](1-Topic.md)
- [Loops](2-topic.md)
- [Functions](3-topic.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
